# DSA_210_Project


Project Idea
In this project, I will analyze how cosmetic sales trends correlate with financial growth and economic downturns. My goal is to determine whether the “Lipstick Index” phenomenon holds true by examining whether consumers shift toward smaller luxury purchases, such as cosmetics, during financial crises. I plan on doing this by comparing cosmetic sales data with economic indicators like GDP growth and stock market performance to identify patterns that reflect consumer behavior during different financial conditions. If a clear relationship exists, this analysis could provide insights into how economic uncertainty influences spending habits on affordable luxuries. 

Datasets 
1. Beauty Product Retail Sales in Istanbul (2021–2023)
This dataset contains yearly retail sales data for beauty products in Istanbul, Turkey.
It will help identify trends in consumer spending on cosmetics over time.
Data will be systematically organized to detect patterns, seasonal variations, and potential economic influences on beauty product sales.

2. Turkey’s GDP, CPI and CCI Data (2021–2023)
These datasets provide Turkey’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), and Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) figures from 2021 to 2023.
It will be used to assess the country’s economic growth and identify potential periods of economic downturns or crisises.

Turkey’s economic data will be analyzed alongside beauty retail sales in İstanbul malls to determine whether economic shifts have some kind of influence on consumer spending on cosmetics like the Lipstick Index phenomenon suggests.
